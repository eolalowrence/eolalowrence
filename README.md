I've listed a lot... right?😅 I don’t know about you, but personally I think that in the area in which you are, you should know and be able to absolutely everything ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at school. Before starting my life at the University, I try to study everything related to programming and design myself :)
- 💞️ What can I say about myself?🤔 Hmm...funny, strange and...a little crazy hahaha!😜 I don't like to sit still, I have to constantly do something. Self-taught. Don't like vulgar people and don't have bad habits. I study foreign languages, draw, keep personal diaries. Science takes an honorable second place among my interests, hehe)⚗️🧬🔬
